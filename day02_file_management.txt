DAY 2 - FILE NAVIGATION

DATE : 28 MAY 2025

> Linux uses a tree like directory structure. Everything starts from `/` (root).

COMMANDS I LEARNED FOR NAVIGATING FILES :

> cd {file_name} - Change directory [from one to another]
> mkdir {file_name} - make a new folder [ create a new folder]
> rmdir {file_name} - remove an empty folder [removing a folder entirely]
> touch {file_name} - create a file inside a folder
> mv {file_name} {new location} - move a folder or file to new location
> cp {file_name) destination - copy files and cp {file_name} -r new destination   directories
> mv {old file_name} {new file_name} - this renames a file
> mv {file_name} {folder}/ renamed_filename2 - move and rename a file at thesame time
> rm -r {folder_name}/ this deletes a directory and everything inside

N/B : rm -r deletes everything without putting it in a recycle bin.
 alternatively you can use rm -ri {folde_name}/ if you want it to ask you before deleting

-r = recursive
-i = interactive (asks for confirmation)

WHAT I DID : Set up my terminal and practiced theses commands and will be pushing the codes in a seperate file

REFLECTION :

I'm more confident using the terminal, I can move around, manage files and folders


Thank you for reading!
