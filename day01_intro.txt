DAY 1 - INTRO TO LINUX
=========================================================================================================

Date: 27-May-2025

Learning Objective : 

1. Definition of Linux
2. Importance of Linux in Cloud Computing, Devops and Cybersecurity

WHAT I LEARNED TODAY

> Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix.
> It powers servers, cloud platforms, Andriod devices and almost all DevOps tools.
> It is light weight, fast, secure and customizable.
> Distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Centos, Debian and Red Hat are all different branches of Linux.

KEY TERMS

> Kernel : The core of the OS.
> Shell : Interface to interact with the OS.
> Terminal : The window where you type the commands.

COMMANDS I TRIED TODAY:

> ls - list files.
> pwd - show present working directory.
> whoami - shows current user.
> clear - this clears everything typed on the terminal.
> exit - exists the shell.

REFLECTION:

I feel excited and enthusiastic! Linux seems powerful but simple, but I believe with consistency I will build
proficiency.

Thank you for reading!
